#########################################
You may need to change the CMSSW version number and Global tag, regarding the data and runs that you are analysing
For a given example the relevant information was taken from here:
https://goo.gl/hbmmZg

As an input data you need either RAW data or FEVT data format:
For instance you may have a look on the list of the example input files
or to check what is available on eos (also on the other CMS sides)
ls /eos/cms/store/data/Run2018C/SingleMuon/RAW

In order to have good statistics it is better to run over larged number of events (> 100000)
